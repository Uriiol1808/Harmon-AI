# Harmon-AI
This project is the result of a collaboration between [Samuel](https://github.com/samu2117) and [Oriol](https://github.com/Uriiol1808). As music and AI enthusiats, we emarked on this journey to create a platform that explores the relationship between music, emotion, and genres using deep learning architectures, including neural networks, coupled with natural language processing techniques.

## About the project
Our web-based application offers two music analysis modules, designed to provide insights into various aspects of songs. With features such as music genre classification and lyric sentiment analysis, users can delve into the nuances of their favorite tracks and discover new perspectives on the music they love.

## Key features
### Music Genre Classification
Our system analyzes uploaded songs to determine the similarity between different music genres.

### Lyrics Sentiment Analysis
By employing natural language processing techniques, our system analyzes song lyrics to determine their emotional tone.
